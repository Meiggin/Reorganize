# Reorganize
# What is success?  
# To laugh often and love much;  
# To win the respect of  Intelligent people  And the affection of children;  
# To earn the    Approbation of honest critics And endure the betrayal of false  Friends;  
# To appreciate beauty; To find the best in others; To give one's Self;  
# To leave the world a little better,  Whether by a healthy child, A Garden patch,  Or a redeemed social condition; 
# To have played and laughed  With enthusiasm  And sung with exultation; 
# To know even one life has  Breathed easier  Because you have lived…… This is to have succeeded.
